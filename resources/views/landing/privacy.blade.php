                            4. Does Cryptsence Share My Personal Information? <br>
                            Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business
                            of selling our users' personal information to others. Cryptsence shares users' personal
                            information only as described below and with the subsidiaries or affiliates of Cryptsence that
                            are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
                            described in this Privacy Notice. <br>
                            Third party service providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on
                            our behalf. Examples include analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing
                            payments, transmitting content, and assessing and managing credit risk. These third-party
                            service providers only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions,
                            but may not use it for other purposes as it will be under cryptsence management control.
                            Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual
                            agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protection laws. <br>

                            businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the
                            transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
                            Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that
                            Cryptsence or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will be one of the
                            transferred assets. <br>

                            believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our regulatory obligations;
                            enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or
                            safety of Cryptsence, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other
                            companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. <br>
                            5. How Secure is My Information? <br>
                            We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work to protect the security of
                            your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.
                            We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection,
                            storage and disclosure of your personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may
                            ask you to verify your identity to protect you against unauthorised access to your account
                            password. We recommend using a unique password for your Cryptsence account that is not utilised
                            for other online accounts and to sign off when you finish using a shared computer. <br>
